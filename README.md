### Project Description
[Project Hub is a user-friendly web platform built for students to showcase their hackathon or ideathon projects. Instead of letting great ideas die in Google Drive folders, Project Hub gives visibility to student innovations and connects them with the right mentors and startup support. Each month, the top 3 projects are featured and given an opportunity to become real, impactful products with the help of IEDC, GDG mentors, and Kerala Startup Mission.]

### The Problem statement
[Many brilliant student projects and startup ideas created during hackathons or ideathons never see the light of day. They’re often forgotten or left incomplete due to lack of visibility, mentorship, and follow-up support.]

### The Solution
[Project Hub helps students turn their ideas into real products by:
Letting them submit and showcase projects
Featuring top 3 projects every month
Offering mentorship from IEDC, GDG, and KSUM
Providing a project gallery to explore and collaborate
Ensuring secure login and access
It’s a launchpad to turn student innovation into real-world impact.]
