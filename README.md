### Project Description
[Project Hub is a user-friendly web platform built for students to showcase their hackathon or ideathon projects. Instead of letting great ideas die in Google Drive folders, Project Hub gives visibility to student innovations and connects them with the right mentors and startup support. Each month, the top 3 projects are featured and given an opportunity to become real, impactful products with the help of IEDC, GDG mentors, and Kerala Startup Mission.]

### The Problem statement
[Many brilliant student projects and startup ideas created during hackathons or ideathons never see the light of day. They’re often forgotten or left incomplete due to lack of visibility, mentorship, and follow-up support.]

### The Solution
[Project Hub bridges the gap between student innovation and real-world implementation by offering:
A centralized platform for students to submit their project ideas.
Monthly curation of top 3 innovative projects for recognition and support.
Startup mentorship and guidance from organizations like IEDC, GDG mentors, and KSUM.
A live project gallery where students can explore others’ ideas, learn, and collaborate.
A seamless and secure authentication system for safe access and management.
By providing both visibility and support, Project Hub aims to transform creative student projects into impactful startups or tech solutions.
